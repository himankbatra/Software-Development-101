# Homework - Week 01

1. Create a function that finds all the numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between X and Y (both included). The numbers obtained should be stored in a comma-separated list.

   ```
   sequence(1, 40)
   // The answer will be "7, 14, 21, 28"
   ```

2. Create a function that takes an array and remove N the elements from the right.

   ```java
   dropRight(int[] elements, int n)
   // dropRight([1,2,3], 2). Result will be [1]
   ```

3. Write a function that accepts a comma-separated sequence of words as input and returns the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting and upper-case them alphabetically.

4. Write a function that eliminates consecutive duplicates of a array.

   ```
   removeConsecutiveDuplicates(["a","a","a", "b","a","c","c","c"])
   // Answer will be ["a","b","a","c"]
   ```

5. Write a function that duplicates elements of an array

   ```
   duplicateElements(["a","b","c], 3)
   // Answer will be ["a","a","a","b","b","b", "c","c","c"]
   ```
